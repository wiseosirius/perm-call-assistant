    },
    "recruiterTips": {
        "openingStrategy": "Lead with work-life balance and call schedule conversation - these are the #1 and #2 drivers for considering change, ahead of compensation",
        "painDiscoveryFocus": "Dig deep on call burden and administrative hassle - these are the primary burnout drivers. Ask about coverage models, backup availability, and time away from practice",
        "genderAwareness": "Female urologists experiencing dramatically higher burnout rates and compensation disparities. Show understanding of work-life integration challenges and family considerations",
        "careerStageMatters": "Early career (<45) showing increased burnout. They need mentorship, partnership track clarity, and realistic expectations about practice building vs late-career seeking reduced call and flexible schedules",
        "technologyQuestions": "Robotic access and training is critical - 76.7% use robotics for prostatectomy. Ask about current access and comfort level. Technology gaps significantly affect practice satisfaction",
        "callCoverageDetails": "Get specifics: nights per week, weekends per month, call volume, acuity level, backup availability. This is the #1 make-or-break factor. Rural practices especially struggle here",
        "practiceStructureExploration": "Understand their tolerance for business management. Many want to escape administrative burden but also value autonomy. Employed positions with medical director roles can bridge this gap",
        "subspecialtyAlignment": "66% identify oncology as subspecialty area, 39.8% robotics. Understand their focus and ensure opportunity matches. Misalignment in case mix is a significant dissatisfier",

        "compensationTiming": "Don't lead with money - it ranks third behind work-life balance and less administrative hassle. Discover financial goals in context of lifestyle priorities",
        "burnoutAwareness": "If physician mentions fatigue, decision paralysis, or chronic worry, these are red flags for burnout. They need immediate change, not just opportunity exploration. Focus on what must be different to prevent recurrence"
